Here’s a clean transcription and breakdown of your audio:

Navbar Issue:

Currently, the navbar is inside a centered container.
It should be full-width (end-to-end) rather than being constrained by the container.
The visual issue is that the navbar looks “contained” and doesn’t appear proper.



Navbar Gamification Fix:

The gamification element in the navbar should be replaced.
Replace it with a pill (small rounded container) that shows:

Level (e.g., “Level 1”)
XP (e.g., “20 XP”)
Current stage (e.g., “Novice”)


This pill should replace the existing gamification in the navbar.




Essentially, display a high-level summary of the user’s progress.
When the user clicks this display, it should open a modal showing the detailed progress.

This modal replaces the need for a separate gamification component.




The main idea:

Navbar should be full-width.
Gamification should be replaced with a concise user progress summary (level + XP + stage).
Clicking the summary opens a modal with full progress details.
