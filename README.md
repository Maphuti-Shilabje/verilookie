# Verilookie: Deepfake and AI-Generated Media Detector

Verilookie is a web-based application designed to detect deepfakes and AI-generated images and videos. It provides users with a tool to analyze media files and determine their authenticity, while also educating them through a gamified quiz system.

## Features

*   **Deepfake Detection:** Analyze images and videos to identify potential deepfakes.
*   **AI-Generated Content Detection:** Detect if an image was generated by an AI model.
*   **Unified Analysis Pipeline:** A multi-layered approach that combines deepfake and AI-generation detection for more accurate results.
*   **Gamified Learning:** Earn XP, level up, and unlock achievements by using the app and taking quizzes.
*   **Personalized Quizzes:** AI-powered quizzes that adapt to your knowledge level about deepfakes and AI-generated content.

## System Architecture

Verilookie is a full-stack web application with a Python backend and a React frontend.

### Frontend (React)

*   **User Interface:** A simple and intuitive interface for uploading files and viewing results.
*   **Components:**
    *   `UploadBox`: Handles file selection and submission.
    *   `ResultCard`: Displays the analysis results.
    *   `QuizPage`: Presents the interactive quizzes.
    *   `Gamification`: Shows the user's progress, level, and achievements.
*   **Communication:** Interacts with the backend via REST APIs.

### Backend (Python - FastAPI)

*   **API Server:** A FastAPI server that exposes endpoints for file analysis and quizzes.
*   **Detection Pipeline:**
    1.  **Deepfake Detector:** A primary model (`prithivMLmods/Deep-Fake-Detector-v2-Model`) to analyze for deepfakes.
    2.  **AI-Generated Content Detector:** A secondary service (NVIDIA AI API) to check for AI-generated content if the primary model is inconclusive.
    3.  **Unified Analysis:** The results from both are combined to provide a single, unified result.
*   **Quiz Generator:**
    *   Uses the Gemini AI API to dynamically generate personalized quizzes based on user performance.
    *   Manages quiz data and user scores.
*   **Data Storage:** Uses JSON files for storing quiz and user performance data (a database would be used in a production environment).

### AI/ML Models

*   **Deepfake Detection:** A pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) model from Hugging Face.
*   **AI-Generated Content:** NVIDIA's AI-generated image detection API.
*   **Quiz Generation:** Google's Gemini API.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   Node.js 14+
*   An NVIDIA API Key (for AI-generated content detection)
*   A Gemini API Key (for quiz generation)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/verilookie.git
    cd verilookie
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    ```bash
    cd src/backend
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Create a `.env` file in the `src/backend` directory and add your API keys:
    ```
    NVIDIA_API_KEY=your_nvidia_api_key
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
    ```

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    ```bash
    cd src/frontend
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Start the backend server:**
    ```bash
    cd src/backend
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
    The backend will be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

2.  **Start the frontend development server:**
    ```bash
    cd src/frontend
    npm start
    ```
    The frontend will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

3.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Gamification

Verilookie uses a gamification system to make learning about deepfakes and AI-generated content more engaging.

*   **Experience Points (XP):** Earn XP for every detection and quiz you complete.
*   **Levels:** As you earn XP, you will level up and unlock new titles.
*   **Achievements:** Unlock badges for completing certain tasks and reaching milestones.
*   **Streaks:** Maintain a daily streak by using the app every day to earn bonus XP.

## Technologies Used

*   **Frontend:** React, CSS
*   **Backend:** Python, FastAPI
*   **Deepfake Detection:** Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch
*   **AI-Generated Content Detection:** NVIDIA AI Foundation Models
*   **Quiz Generation:** Google Gemini API
